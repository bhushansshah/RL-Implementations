## 🔎 About
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a field of machine learning concerned with training agents to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment.  
This repo will serve as a growing collection of RL algorithms with clean, modular code and educational explanations.

## ✅ Implemented Algorithms
Currently, the repo is under development. Algorithms will be added periodically.  
Here’s the growing list of implementations:

- [x] Multi-Armed Bandits  
- [x] Jack's Car Problem - I
- [x] Jack's Car Problem - II
- [x] Gambler's Problem
